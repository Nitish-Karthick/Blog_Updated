        <h2>What is a Cybersecurity Threat?</h2>
        <p>A cybersecurity threat is any malicious activity or event that aims to compromise the security, integrity, or availability of data, networks, or systems. These threats can originate from various sources, including individuals, organizations, or nation-states, and can cause significant financial, reputational, and operational damage.</p>

        <h3>Types of Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
<p>
<b>1. Malware :</b>
<br><br>
Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or disable systems.
<br><br>
Examples:
Viruses: Attach themselves to legitimate programs and spread when executed.
Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
Trojans: Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious actions.
Spyware: Collects user data without consent.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Phishing :</b>
<br><br>
 Deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information by posing as a trustworthy entity.

Examples:
Fake emails from "banks" requesting login credentials.
Clone websites that mimic legitimate platforms.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks :</b>
<br><br>
 Attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal or 
manipulate data.

Examples:
Eavesdropping on public Wi-Fi.
HTTPS spoofing.
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks :</b>
<br><br>
 Overloading a network, server, or website to make it unavailable.

Examples:
Flooding servers with excessive requests.
Botnet-driven DDoS attacks.
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Social Engineering :</b>
<br><br>
 Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information.

Examples:
Pretexting: Pretending to be someone trustworthy to gain access.
Baiting: Offering something enticing to get victims to provide information.
<br>
<br>
<b>6.Insider Threats :</b>
<br><br>
Threats posed by employees or individuals within an organization.

Examples:
Disgruntled employees stealing or leaking sensitive data.
Accidental mishandling of confidential information.
<br>
<br>
<b>7. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) :</b>
<br><br>
 Long-term, targeted attacks often conducted by nation-states or highly skilled groups.

Examples:
Espionage to steal intellectual property.
Cyberwarfare targeting critical infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
<b>8.Zero-Day Exploits :</b>
<br><br>
 Exploiting vulnerabilities in software before developers can patch them.

Examples:
Attacks on newly discovered flaws in operating systems or applications.
<br>
<br>
<b>9.SQL Injection :</b>
<br><br>
 Inserting malicious SQL code into a database query to manipulate or access data.

Examples:
Exploiting web forms to access user accounts or sensitive data.
<br>
<br>
<b>10. Cryptojacking :</b>
<br><br>
 Unauthorized use of a computer's resources to mine cryptocurrency.

Examples:
Infecting devices with malware to perform mining operations.
<br>
<br>
<b>11.IoT-Based Attacks :</b>
<br>
<br>
 Exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Examples:
Hacking smart home devices.
Taking control of industrial IoT systems.
<br>
<br>
<b>12.Supply Chain Attacks:</b>
<br>
<br>
 Targeting vulnerabilities in third-party vendors or suppliers.

Examples:
Infecting software updates with malware.
Compromising hardware during manufacturing. <br></p>
        
        <h3>How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
        <p>Regular Updates: Keep systems, applications, and devices up-to-date.

Firewalls and Antivirus: Use robust security tools to detect and prevent threats.

Employee Training: Educate staff on recognizing and avoiding phishing or social engineering attacks.

Strong Passwords: Use unique, complex passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.

Data Backups: Regularly back up important data to minimize ransomware damage.

Network Security: Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).</p>
